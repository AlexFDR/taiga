# Taiga

#This is a fork of the original Taiga program to support features that I wish to be supported.

Taiga is an open source, lightweight, anime tracker for Windows. It can automatically detect the episodes you're watching on your computer and synchronize your progress with online services such as [Hummingbird](http://hummingbird.me) and [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net). It helps you manage your list, discover new series, share watched episodes and download new ones.

Visit our [home page](http://taiga.erengy.com) for more information. See the [guidelines](https://github.com/erengy/taiga/wiki/Guidelines) if you'd like to contribute. Here's [how to compile](https://github.com/erengy/taiga/wiki/How-to-Compile).

Changes:
* Added support for:
 * KissAnime.to
* Removed Auto-updater
